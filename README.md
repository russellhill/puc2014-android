Push Up Challenge 2014 app for Android

This is a simple app that allows you to track how many push-ups are required for the current day of the year.

Tap the large number that shows the number of push-ups for the day in order to put a checkmark in it and record the fact that you have completed the challenge for the day. The app will also attempt to tweet your progress at this point.
